      "narration": "If you're working with AI to generate reports, you've probably faced this frustrating reality: your AI system works sometimes, but not consistently. As someone who's run an AI consulting agency for over a year, I've seen this challenge across every industry - from startups to cybersecurity firms. Today, I'll share the practical solutions I've discovered to make AI reporting truly reliable.",

      "title": "Quick Wins - The Foundation",
      "narration": "Let's start with the simple fixes that deliver immediate results. First, always format your data in markdown - LLMs are trained on it and respond better. Second, write crystal-clear prompts. Just like humans, AI gets confused by vague instructions. And third, choose the right model for your specific task. GPT-4 isn't always the answer - sometimes Gemini's 2-million token context window is exactly what you need for detailed reports.",

      "narration": "Here's a game-changer: add the phrase 'explain your reasoning step by step' to your prompts. This technique, called Chain-of-Thought prompting, dramatically improves accuracy. Also, include few-shot examples - show the AI what good outputs look like. These examples guide the model toward the responses you actually want.",

Create a dataset with sample inputs and expected outputs, then design metrics to score your AI's performance. This isn't just testing - it's optimization. You can automatically generate better prompts and measure improvement over time.",

      "title": "The Reliability Mathematics",
      "narration": "Here's the crucial insight most people miss: complexity kills reliability. If each AI call has a 95% success rate, but your system makes 10 calls, your overall reliability drops to just 60%. Every additional API call exponentially reduces your system's dependability. Design for simplicity - can you solve the problem in 2 calls instead of 3? That's not just efficiency, that's exponentially better reliability.",

      "narration": "Ready to implement these improvements? Here's your checklist: Use markdown formatting and clear prompts. Choose the right model and optimize settings. Apply chain-of-thought prompting with examples. Build evaluation pipelines to measure and improve performance. And most importantly, simplify your system - fewer API calls mean exponentially better reliability. These aren't just theories - they're battle-tested solutions from real client projects.",
